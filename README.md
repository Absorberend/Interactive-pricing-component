# Interactive pricing component
This is my solution for the "Interactive pricing component" challenge of Frontend Mentor.

This time I used Grid for the design, which was nice to play with! 
It took me a while to find out how to change the track color of the slider, but I got there üòä. 

These page view ranges and monthly price totals were given by Frontend Mentor:

- 10K pageviews / $8 per month
- 50K pageviews / $12 per month
- 100K pageviews / $16 per month
- 500k pageviews / $24 per month
- 1M pageviews / $36 per month
